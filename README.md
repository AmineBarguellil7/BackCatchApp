Collaborating closely with a team of four, I developed the Clubmaster web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) -> a dynamic platform that seamlessly connects users and helps them join clubs easily.
This project showcases my proficiency across various technologies and reflects my dedication to building engaging web experiences.

This is the backend code. You can find the frontend code here https://github.com/AmineBarguellil7/CatchApp_The_Innovators.
